# Refresh Token Security and Replay Protection

## Overview

Your FindMyRent API now implements comprehensive replay protection for refresh tokens using a multi-layered security approach.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Unique Token Identifiers (JTI)**
- Each refresh token contains a unique `jti` (JWT ID) field
- Generated using cryptographically secure random values
- Prevents token collision and enables precise tracking

### 2. **One-Time Use Enforcement**
- Refresh tokens can only be used once
- Used tokens are immediately blacklisted in Redis
- Attempts to reuse tokens are detected and blocked

### 3. **Token Family Tracking**
- Related tokens share a `token_family` identifier
- Enables detection of token theft scenarios
- Allows invalidation of entire token chains

### 4. **Replay Attack Detection**
When a used token is replayed:
```
1. System detects token reuse
2. Invalidates entire token family
3. Logs security incident
4. Returns error indicating all sessions invalidated
```

### 5. **Token Rotation**
- New refresh token generated on each use
- Old token immediately invalidated
- Maintains security while providing seamless experience

## Attack Scenarios and Mitigations

### Scenario 1: Token Interception
**Attack**: Attacker intercepts refresh token
**Mitigation**: 
- First use (legitimate or malicious) invalidates token
- If attacker uses first, legitimate user's next attempt triggers family invalidation
- If user uses first, attacker's attempt is blocked

### Scenario 2: Replay Attack
**Attack**: Attacker replays captured refresh token
**Mitigation**:
- Token marked as used on first attempt
- Subsequent replay attempts are immediately rejected
- Family invalidation protects against sophisticated attacks

### Scenario 3: Token Theft Detection
**Attack**: Attacker steals and uses token before user
**Mitigation**:
- When legitimate user tries to refresh, system detects reuse
- Entire token family invalidated
- All user sessions terminated for security

## Security Configuration

### Redis Keys Used
```
used_refresh_token:{jti} -> "used" (TTL: 7 days)
token_family:{family_id} -> "invalidated" (TTL: 7 days)
user_tokens:{user_id}:* -> tracking keys
```

### Environment Variables
```
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7    # Token lifetime
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15 # Short-lived access tokens
SECRET_KEY=<strong-secret>     # JWE encryption key
```

## Implementation Details

### Token Structure
```json
{
  "user_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "token_family": "abc123...", 
  "jti": "xyz789...",          // Unique identifier
  "issued_at": 1634567890,
  "type": "refresh",
  "exp": 1635172690
}
```

### Security Workflow
```
1. User logs in → Generate token family + JTI
2. Token used for refresh → Mark JTI as used
3. New token generated → New JTI, same family
4. Replay detected → Invalidate entire family
5. Logout → Mark current JTI as used
```

## Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Cryptographic Security**: JWE encryption with A256GCM
✅ **Unique Identifiers**: Secure random JTI generation  
✅ **One-Time Use**: Redis-based token blacklisting
✅ **Token Rotation**: Fresh tokens on each refresh
✅ **Family Invalidation**: Breach detection and response
✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Security event tracking
✅ **Short Access Tokens**: 15-minute lifetime reduces exposure
✅ **Proper Error Handling**: No information leakage

## Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Replay attack detections
- Token family invalidations  
- Failed refresh attempts
- Unusual token usage patterns

### Metrics to Track
- Token refresh rate per user
- Failed authentication attempts
- Family invalidation frequency
- Session duration patterns

## Production Considerations

### High Availability
- Redis clustering for blacklist storage
- Backup/restore procedures for security data
- Graceful degradation during Redis outages

### Performance
- Redis TTL cleanup for used tokens
- Efficient key patterns for cleanup
- Token validation caching strategies

### Compliance
- Token data retention policies
- Audit trail requirements
- Privacy considerations for logged data

## Security Status: ✅ PROTECTED

The refresh token system now provides enterprise-grade protection against:
- Replay attacks
- Token theft
- Session hijacking  
- Cross-device security breaches

The implementation follows OAuth 2.0 security best practices and provides comprehensive protection against common JWT vulnerabilities.
